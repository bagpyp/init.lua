# Keymap Documentation Updates Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the documentation updates made to ensure consistency between the actual keymaps configured in the Neovim configuration and the documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. keymap-cheatsheet.md
#### Fixed Incorrect Mappings:
- Changed `Shift+Tab` to `<leader>fr` for Recent Files
- Changed `gi` to `gI` for Go to Implementation  
- Changed `Space+` prefix to `<leader>` for consistency
- Fixed Git keymaps to reflect actual configuration

#### Added Missing Keymaps:
- Added comprehensive LSP navigation keymaps (gD, <C-k>, <leader>D, etc.)
- Added all Telescope keymaps (<leader>fh, <leader>fc, <leader>fm, etc.)
- Added Git hunks keymaps from Gitsigns (]c, [c, <leader>hs, etc.)
- Added Git operations from Fugitive (<leader>gs, <leader>gd, etc.)
- Added text editing utilities (gcc, gc, <, >, etc.)
- Added macOS-specific keymaps section

#### Removed Non-existent Keymaps:
- Removed `Space+gf` (Git Files) - not configured

### 2. testing.md
#### Removed Non-existent Features:
- Removed Debug test keymaps (<leader>td, <leader>tdf)
- Removed Stop test keymap (<leader>ts conflict)
- Removed test navigation keymaps (]f, [f, gt)
- Added note that test navigation is via summary panel

### 3. debugging.md  
#### Removed Non-configured Keymaps:
- Removed Shift+F5 (Stop Debugging)
- Removed conditional breakpoint keymaps
- Removed breakpoint management keymaps
- Removed test debugging integration
- Removed watch expressions keymaps
- Removed thread switching keymaps
- Removed exception breakpoint keymaps
- Removed debug configuration selection keymaps
- Removed time travel debugging keymaps
- Added notes explaining these features require DAP commands

### 4. refactoring.md
#### Removed Non-configured Refactorings:
- Removed Extract Variable (<leader>rv)
- Removed Extract Function (<leader>re)
- Removed advanced rename keymaps
- Removed extract to file keymaps
- Removed change signature keymaps
- Removed convert refactorings
- Removed pull up/push down keymaps
- Removed import management keymaps
- Removed language-specific refactoring keymaps
- Added notes to use LSP code actions instead

### 5. multicursor.md
#### Fixed Conflicting Keymaps:
- Removed conflicting cursor creation keymaps
- Clarified Ctrl+Up/Down are for selection expansion
- Added note about advanced features requiring manual configuration

### 6. README.md
#### Updated Main Documentation:
- Changed all `Space+` to `<leader>` prefix
- Fixed Shift+Tab to <leader>fr
- Updated Find & Search section with actual keymaps
- Added missing search keymaps
- Corrected all section headers

## Key Findings

### Configured but Undocumented:
1. Many Telescope keymaps for navigation
2. Git operations from Fugitive and Gitsigns
3. LSP navigation and workspace commands
4. Text editing utilities
5. macOS-specific keymaps

### Documented but Not Configured:
1. Many advanced refactoring features
2. Debug configuration management
3. Test debugging integration
4. Advanced multi-cursor features
5. Language-specific refactorings

### Conflicts Found:
1. <leader>gc - Git Commits vs Git Commit
2. <leader>gb - Git Branches vs Git Blame
3. <leader>td - Toggle Deleted vs Debug Test
4. Ctrl+Up - Expand Selection vs Add Cursor Above

## Recommendations for Future Development

### High Priority:
1. Implement test debugging integration
2. Add conditional breakpoint support
3. Configure import management keymaps
4. Resolve git keymap conflicts

### Medium Priority:
1. Add extract variable/function refactorings
2. Implement debug configuration selection
3. Add more multi-cursor features
4. Configure language-specific refactorings

### Low Priority:
1. Add time travel debugging (if DAP adapter supports)
2. Implement pull up/push down refactorings
3. Add advanced signature change features
4. Configure exception breakpoint management

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Always use `<leader>` prefix** instead of `Space` for clarity
2. **Document platform-specific keymaps** separately
3. **Add notes** when features require plugin commands instead of keymaps
4. **Keep documentation in sync** with actual configuration
5. **Test all documented keymaps** before publishing

## Files Modified

1. `/docs/keymap-cheatsheet.md` - Main keymap reference
2. `/docs/workflows/testing.md` - Testing workflow documentation
3. `/docs/workflows/debugging.md` - Debugging workflow documentation
4. `/docs/workflows/refactoring.md` - Refactoring workflow documentation
5. `/docs/workflows/multicursor.md` - Multi-cursor workflow documentation
6. `/README.md` - Main project documentation

## Validation

All changes have been made to ensure:
- Documentation reflects actual configured keymaps
- Non-existent features are clearly marked
- Users have accurate information about available shortcuts
- Conflicts are documented for future resolution
