## 📝 Notes for Future Claude Sessions

### Getting Started
1. Read `vim-game/specs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for system overview
2. Check this TODO.md for current priorities
3. Run `npm install:all` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm test` to ensure everything works
5. Check recent git commits for context

### Development Workflow
1. Pick a task from Current Sprint
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/task-name`
3. Implement with tests
4. Update documentation
5. Submit PR description in CHANGELOG.md

### Key Files to Understand
- `server/src/game/VimGameEngine.ts` - Core game logic
